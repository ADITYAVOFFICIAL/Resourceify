* [ ] Fetch data from APIs using JavaScript (fetch or Axios)
* [ ] Handle asynchronous operations (Promises, async/await)
* [ ] Explore GraphQL for more efficient data fetching

## Routing and Navigation

* [ ] Implement client-side routing (React Router, Vue Router)
* [ ] Create navigation menus and links

* [ ] Explore task runners (e.g., Gulp)
* [ ] Learn about module systems (CommonJS, ES6 Modules)

## Testing

* [ ] Write unit tests for your frontend code (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library)
* [ ] Practice TDD (Test-Driven Development)

## Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

* [ ] Convert your app into a PWA
* [ ] Implement service workers for offline support

## Deployment

* [ ] Deploy your frontend app to a web hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel)
* [ ] Configure domain and SSL

## Accessibility

* [ ] Ensure your app is accessible (follow WCAG guidelines)
* [ ] Test with screen readers and accessibility tools

## Real-world Projects

* [ ] Work on personal or open-source projects
* [ ] Collaborate with others on frontend projects
* [ ] Seek internships or job opportunities as a frontend developer
