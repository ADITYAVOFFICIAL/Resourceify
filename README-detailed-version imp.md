# DATA SCIENCE ROADMAP

### Why this?
This repository can be used as a roadmap by a person to proceed in this broad area of Data Science.

### How are things classified here?
It is not that easy to classify subjects in Data Science. Some courses may correspond clearly to only one category, some others may belong to more than one, etc. I have tried to simplify the categories of interest in what you can see in the table of contents.
